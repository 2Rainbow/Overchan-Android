This is a notification that your application, Overchan Android, with  <br/>
package ID nya.miku.wishmaster.sfw, has been suspended from the Google Play  <br/>
Store.<br/>
<br/>
REASON FOR SUSPENSION:Violation of the sexually explicit material provision  <br/>
of the Content Policy.<br/>
<br/>
After a regular review, we have determined that your app contains images  <br/>
with nudity. This violates the Content Policy. Please refer to the Sex and  <br/>
Nudity policy help article for more information.<br/>
<br/>
This particular app has been disabled as a policy strike. If your developer  <br/>
account is still in good standing, you may revise and upload a policy  <br/>
compliant version of this application as a new package name.<br/>
<br/>
This notification also serves as notice for other apps in your catalog. You  <br/>
can avoid further app suspensions by immediately ensuring that no other  <br/>
apps in your catalog are in violation of (but not limited to) the above  <br/>
policy. Please also ensure your apps' compliance with the Developer  <br/>
Distribution Agreement and Content Policy.<br/>
<br/>
All violations are tracked. Additional suspensions of any nature may result  <br/>
in the termination of your developer account, and investigation and  <br/>
possible termination of related Google accounts. If your account is  <br/>
terminated, payments will cease and Google may recover the proceeds of any  <br/>
past sales and/or the cost of any associated fees (such as chargebacks and  <br/>
transaction fees) from you.<br/>
